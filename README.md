Legacy software for [due.moe](https://due.moe)


# The What

[due.moe](https://due.moe) used to be simple, slow, and server-sided; now it's fast, multi-architecture, and massive in scale.

I originally whipped up this initial prototype of [due.moe](https://due.moe) in a few hours, since I would be abroad for much of the summer of 2023. This would leave me unable to access the add-ons, tools, and utilities that I had installed on my desktop PC.

This prototype works, and it might actually be slightly faster than the current [due.moe](https://due.moe) if you're on a 56k modem, or worse, and can't reliably spew large amounts of requests.

You can absolutely deploy this project, but it won't be very fast, or up-to-date.
